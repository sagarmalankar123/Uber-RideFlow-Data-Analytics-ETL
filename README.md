# Uber-end-to-end-Data-Analytics
> This document outlines a comprehensive data pipeline designed to process and analyze Uber ride data. The pipeline encompasses data loading, transformation, exporting to BigQuery, SQL querying, and creating a Looker dashboard for data visualization.

# Data Loading
> The process begins with the implementation of the load_data_from_api function, which interfaces with an API endpoint to retrieve raw Uber ride data. This function leverages the requests library to fetch the data and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame. The obtained data includes a wide array of attributes related to Uber rides.

# Data Transformation
> Following data acquisition, the pipeline moves into the transformation phase. Several transformations are applied to enhance data usability and structure. Notably, time-related attributes, such as pickup and dropoff times, are converted into the datetime data type. These temporal attributes are then deconstructed into components like hour, day, month, and year. This process results in the creation of the datetime_dim dimension table.

> Additional dimension tables are generated for specific attributes including passenger count, trip distance, rate code, pickup and dropoff locations, and payment type. These dimension tables capture unique values from the original dataset and serve as reference tables for enriched analysis.

# BigQuery Export
> The pipeline proceeds to export the transformed data into Google BigQuery. The export_data_to_big_query function is employed for this purpose. Configuration settings are specified in the io_config.yaml file, enabling seamless integration with BigQuery. The fact table and dimension tables are populated in the BigQuery dataset, facilitating efficient querying.

# SQL Querying
The processed data within BigQuery becomes the foundation for conducting complex SQL queries. A representative example of SQL querying is provided in the pipeline, where the fact_table is joined with the dimension tables to extract meaningful insights. Additional queries can be crafted to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

# Looker Dashboard Creation
> To present the findings effectively, a Looker dashboard is generated. The Looker platform interfaces with the processed data in BigQuery, allowing users to create interactive visualizations, reports, and dashboards. The Looker dashboard enables stakeholders to intuitively explore the Uber ride data and glean valuable business insights.

> In conclusion, this data pipeline offers a systematic approach to Uber ride data analysis. By seamlessly integrating data loading, transformation, export to BigQuery, SQL querying, and Looker visualization, the pipeline empowers data professionals and stakeholders to extract actionable insights from the Uber ride data.
